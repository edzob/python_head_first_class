Python development:
Local.. with text files and a local editor.. 
Python is on the stick and on Mac OS/X by default

Something to try.. Coding in the cloud.

Editor -> Cloud9 -> https://c9.io/site/pricing/

Link to Python repro: https://c9.io/edzob/python_head_first_class
Backend file storage: https://github.com/edzob/python_head_first_class

Challenge.. Edzo does not have that much experience :)
